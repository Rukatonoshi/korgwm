# Why?

**Back in 2010** I used the most impressive WM I think &mdash; WMFS (version 1).
Then WMFS author ([@xorg62](https://github.com/xorg62)) decided to completely drop WMFS and started working on WMFS2.
It lacks a lot of functionality: EWMH, Xft, always\_on\_top, ...
And I **solely** supported my personal fork of WMFS: [github.com/zhmylove/wmfs](https://github.com/zhmylove/wmfs).

Over time, new technologies emerged and new WM features were required to feel entirely at home, so I dropped WMFS too.
Since that days, I always had **the idea of writing my own WM**.
The perfect time is now.

# What is?

**korgwm** is MY personal WM.
I do NOT want to make it highly customizable as I do know my wishes pretty well.
I decided to write it in [Perl](https://www.perl.org/), as Perl is the best language ever.
This WM is not a proof of concept, nor a society-oriented pet-project.
It's just my instrument that I'm going to use on a daily basis.

# Contribution

**Yes**, I do appreciate contribution.
But it should not break the default behaviour of *korgwm*, as I'm going to tune it for myself.
Though this is discussible in your PRs.
Welcome!
